### **Difference Between a Queue and a Priority Queue**

While both **queue** and **priority queue** are abstract data structures that manage collections of elements, their behavior and the way elements are ordered differ significantly.

Here's a comparison of **queue** and **priority queue**:

### 1. **Ordering of Elements:**

- **Queue:**
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: In a queue, elements are processed in the order they are added, meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed (like a line at a ticket counter).
  - **Order of insertion is preserved**: No element is given special priority.

- **Priority Queue:**
  - **Priority-Based Ordering**: In a priority queue, elements are ordered based on their priority, not by the order of insertion. The element with the highest (or lowest, depending on implementation) priority is always processed first.
  - **Order of insertion may be ignored**: New elements are placed based on their priority, not necessarily where they were inserted.

### 2. **Basic Operations:**

- **Queue:**
  - **enqueue (push)**: Add an element to the back of the queue.
  - **dequeue (pop)**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
  - **front()**: Access the front element without removing it.
  - **empty()**: Check if the queue is empty.
  
- **Priority Queue:**
  - **push**: Insert an element into the priority queue, where the element is placed according to its priority.
  - **pop**: Remove and return the element with the highest (or lowest) priority.
  - **top()**: Access the element with the highest (or lowest) priority without removing it.
  - **empty()**: Check if the priority queue is empty.

### 3. **Underlying Data Structures:**

- **Queue:**
  - A typical queue is often implemented using **arrays**, **linked lists**, or **deques**.
  - Operations like enqueue and dequeue happen in constant time (**O(1)**) for simple implementations.

- **Priority Queue:**
  - A priority queue is typically implemented using a **heap** (binary heap, min-heap, or max-heap) or a **sorted list** (though this is less efficient).
  - Operations like push (insertion) and pop (removal) typically happen in **O(log n)** time due to the reordering of elements to maintain the heap property.

### 4. **Use Cases:**

- **Queue:**
  - Suitable for problems where the order of processing matters, and you need to process elements in the order they arrive.
  - **Examples**: 
    - Task scheduling (processing tasks in the order they arrive).
    - Printing jobs queue in a printer.
    - Breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.

- **Priority Queue:**
  - Suitable for problems where elements must be processed based on priority, rather than the order of arrival.
  - **Examples**: 
    - Task scheduling with varying priorities.
    - Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path finding in graphs (min-priority queue).
    - Huffman coding (compression algorithms).
    - Implementing a **job scheduling** system where more important jobs are processed first.

### 5. **Example of Use:**

#### **Queue Example (FIFO):**
A simple queue where we insert and remove tasks based on the order they were added.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::queue<int> q;
    
    // Enqueue elements
    q.push(1);
    q.push(2);
    q.push(3);
    
    // Dequeue elements (FIFO)
    while (!q.empty()) {
        std::cout << q.front() << std::endl;  // Print the front element
        q.pop();  // Remove the front element
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
```

#### **Priority Queue Example (Priority-Based):**
A priority queue where elements are ordered by their priority (highest priority is processed first).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::priority_queue<int> pq;  // Max priority queue
    
    // Insert elements with priorities
    pq.push(23);
    pq.push(56);
    pq.push(12);
    pq.push(98);
    
    // Pop elements (highest priority first)
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        std::cout << pq.top() << std::endl;  // Print the top element (highest priority)
        pq.pop();  // Remove the top element
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
98
56
23
12
```

### 6. **Performance Considerations:**

- **Queue:**
  - **Enqueue and Dequeue Operations**: O(1) for both enqueue and dequeue operations, assuming the underlying data structure (like a deque or a linked list) allows it.
  
- **Priority Queue:**
  - **Push Operation**: O(log n) because the heap structure needs to be adjusted to maintain the priority order.
  - **Pop Operation**: O(log n) for similar reasons, as it needs to maintain the heap property after removing the highest (or lowest) priority element.

### Summary Table:

| Feature                         | **Queue**                                  | **Priority Queue**                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Order of Elements**           | FIFO (First In, First Out)                 | Based on priority (highest/lowest priority first) |
| **Insertion Order**             | Maintains insertion order                  | Order depends on priority                   |
| **Accessing Elements**          | Front element accessed first               | Top element (highest priority) accessed first |
| **Underlying Structure**        | Typically array, linked list, or deque     | Typically a heap (max-heap or min-heap)     |
| **Time Complexity (Insertion)** | O(1) for simple implementations            | O(log n) for heap-based implementation      |
| **Time Complexity (Removal)**   | O(1) for simple implementations            | O(log n) for heap-based implementation      |
| **Common Use Cases**            | Task scheduling (order matters), BFS       | Task scheduling (priority-based), Dijkstra’s algorithm, Huffman coding |

In summary, **queues** are useful for **order-preserving** operations, while **priority queues** are designed for situations where **priority** determines the order in which elements are processed.
