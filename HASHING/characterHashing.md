### This is the explanation of the question above called "characterHashing.cpp" ###


This code is a simple program that counts the frequency of each character in a given string and allows the user to query the frequency of specific characters. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### 1. **Include Required Libraries**

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```

- `#include<bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a header file that includes almost all standard C++ libraries.
- `using namespace std;`: This allows the use of standard library functions and objects without the `std::` prefix.

---

### 2. **Input the String**

```cpp
string s;
cin >> s;
```

- A string `s` is declared to store the input.
- `cin >> s` takes a single word (string) as input.

---

### 3. **Precompute Character Frequencies**

```cpp
int hash[26] = {0};
for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
{
   hash[s[i] - 'a']++;
}
```

- `hash[26]`: An array initialized to zero, where each index corresponds to a letter in the English alphabet (`'a'` = 0, `'b'` = 1, ..., `'z'` = 25).
- `s[i] - 'a'`: This converts a character into an index. For example:
  - `'a' - 'a' = 0`
  - `'b' - 'a' = 1`
  - ...
  - `'z' - 'a' = 25`
- `hash[s[i] - 'a']++`: Increments the count of the character `s[i]` in the `hash` array.

---

### 4. **Input Number of Queries**

```cpp
int q;
cin >> q;
```

- `q` is the number of queries.

---

### 5. **Query the Frequency of Characters**

```cpp
while(q--){
    char c;
    cin >> c;

    //fetch
    cout << hash[c - 'a'] << endl;
}
```

- A loop runs `q` times to handle the queries.
- Each query:
  - Reads a character `c`.
  - Calculates the index for `c` using `c - 'a'`.
  - Prints the frequency of `c` from the `hash` array.

---

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
```
abacabad
4
a
b
c
z
```

#### Execution:
1. **String Input:** `s = "abacabad"`
2. **Precompute Frequencies:**
   - `hash[0] = 4` (for 'a')
   - `hash[1] = 2` (for 'b')
   - `hash[2] = 1` (for 'c')
   - `hash[3] = 1` (for 'd')
   - All other indices remain `0`.
3. **Number of Queries:** `q = 4`
4. **Processing Queries:**
   - Query 1 (`c = 'a'`): Output `hash[0] = 4`.
   - Query 2 (`c = 'b'`): Output `hash[1] = 2`.
   - Query 3 (`c = 'c'`): Output `hash[2] = 1`.
   - Query 4 (`c = 'z'`): Output `hash[25] = 0`.

#### Output:
```
4
2
1
0
```

---

### Key Points:
1. **Efficiency:** The program precomputes character frequencies in \( O(n) \), and each query is answered in \( O(1) \).
2. **Assumptions:**
   - Input string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
   - Queries are also lowercase English letters.
3. **Applications:** This method is useful for handling repeated queries efficiently after a single preprocessing step.

### LINE BY LINE EXECUTION ###

### Execution Results:

1. **Input String**: `"abacabad"`
2. **Queries**: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'z']`
3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:

#### **Step 1: Initialization**
- A hash table (array) is created with 26 elements, all initialized to `0`:
  ```
  hash = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]  // 26 zeros
  ```

---

#### **Step 2: Precompute Frequencies**
- Each character in the input string is processed to compute its frequency:
  - `'a'`: `hash['a' - 'a'] = hash[0] += 1` → `hash[0] = 1`
  - `'b'`: `hash['b' - 'a'] = hash[1] += 1` → `hash[1] = 1`
  - `'a'`: `hash['a' - 'a'] = hash[0] += 1` → `hash[0] = 2`
  - `'c'`: `hash['c' - 'a'] = hash[2] += 1` → `hash[2] = 1`
  - `'a'`: `hash['a' - 'a'] = hash[0] += 1` → `hash[0] = 3`
  - `'b'`: `hash['b' - 'a'] = hash[1] += 1` → `hash[1] = 2`
  - `'a'`: `hash['a' - 'a'] = hash[0] += 1` → `hash[0] = 4`
  - `'d'`: `hash['d' - 'a'] = hash[3] += 1` → `hash[3] = 1`

- Final `hash` table:
  ```
  hash = [4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]  // Frequencies of a, b, c, d
  ```

---

#### **Step 3: Process Queries**
Each query fetches the frequency of a character from the hash table:

- Query `'a'`:
  - `hash['a' - 'a'] = hash[0] = 4`
  - Result: `4`
  
- Query `'b'`:
  - `hash['b' - 'a'] = hash[1] = 2`
  - Result: `2`
  
- Query `'c'`:
  - `hash['c' - 'a'] = hash[2] = 1`
  - Result: `1`

- Query `'z'`:
  - `hash['z' - 'a'] = hash[25] = 0`
  - Result: `0`

---

### **Output**
- Hash table after precomputing:  
  `[4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]`
- Query results:  
  `[4, 2, 1, 0]`

---

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### **Line 1: Initialization**
```cpp
int hash[26] = {0};
```
- Creates an array `hash` of size 26 to store frequencies of letters ('a' to 'z').

#### **Line 2-5: Precomputing Frequencies**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
    hash[s[i] - 'a']++;
}
```
- Loops through each character in the string `s` and increments the count at the corresponding index in `hash`.

#### **Line 6-11: Query Processing**
```cpp
while (q--) {
    char c;
    cin >> c;
    cout << hash[c - 'a'] << endl;
}
```
- For each query:
  - Reads a character `c`.
  - Converts it into an index (`c - 'a'`) and fetches its frequency from `hash`.
  - Prints the result.
