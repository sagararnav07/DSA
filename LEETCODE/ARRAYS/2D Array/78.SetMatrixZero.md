### Set Matrix Zero Traversal how the 2D array traverse it is a row-major traversal

### This code is little different from the code on leetcode but it only for traversal explanation
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    // Step 1: Get the number of rows (m) and columns (n)
    int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size(); 
    
    // Step 2: Create row and col arrays to mark which rows and columns should be set to zero
    vector<int> row(m, 0), col(n, 0);

    // Step 3: First pass - Mark the rows and columns that contain a zero
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { // Iterate through each row
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // Iterate through each column
            if (matrix[i][j] == 0) { // If a zero is found
                row[i] = 1; // Mark the corresponding row as needing to be zeroed
                col[j] = 1; // Mark the corresponding column as needing to be zeroed
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Second pass - Set elements to zero based on row and column markers
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { // Iterate through each row again
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) { // Iterate through each column again
            if (row[i] == 1 || col[j] == 1) { // If the row or column was marked
                matrix[i][j] = 0; // Set the matrix cell to zero
            }
        }
    }
}

### Traversal

Alright! Let's go even deeper into how this traversal works **step by step** in a **4Ã—4 matrix** when `i` iterates over rows and `j` iterates over columns.

---

## **Code Breakdown**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {  // Iterate through each row
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {  // Iterate through each column
        if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {  // If a zero is found
            row[i] = 1;  // Mark the corresponding row as needing to be zeroed
            col[j] = 1;  // Mark the corresponding column as needing to be zeroed
        }
    }
}
```
---

## **Traversal Order**
- The **outer loop (`i`) controls the rows**, meaning it processes the **entire first row before moving to the next row**.
- The **inner loop (`j`) controls the columns**, meaning it scans the elements **one by one from left to right within the current row**.

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  // Found a zero at (1,1)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)  // Found a zero at (2,3)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)

---
## **Example Matrix**
Let's consider this **4Ã—4 matrix** before traversal:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
5 & 0 & 7 & 8 \\
9 & 10 & 11 & 0 \\
13 & 14 & 15 & 16
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, let's analyze how the loops iterate through this matrix.

---
## **Step-by-Step Iteration**

### **Iteration 1: i = 0 (First Row)**
- The first row is `(0,0) â†’ (0,1) â†’ (0,2) â†’ (0,3)`
- The loop processes:
  ```
  (0,0) â†’ 1 (No zero)
  (0,1) â†’ 2 (No zero)
  (0,2) â†’ 3 (No zero)
  (0,3) â†’ 4 (No zero)
  ```
- **No zero found, so no changes in row or col arrays.**

---
### **Iteration 2: i = 1 (Second Row)**
- The second row is `(1,0) â†’ (1,1) â†’ (1,2) â†’ (1,3)`
- The loop processes:
  ```
  (1,0) â†’ 5 (No zero)
  (1,1) â†’ 0 (Zero found!) â†’ row[1] = 1, col[1] = 1
  (1,2) â†’ 7 (No zero)
  (1,3) â†’ 8 (No zero)
  ```
- **We marked:** `row[1] = 1`, `col[1] = 1` because `(1,1)` is a zero.

---
### **Iteration 3: i = 2 (Third Row)**
- The third row is `(2,0) â†’ (2,1) â†’ (2,2) â†’ (2,3)`
- The loop processes:
  ```
  (2,0) â†’ 9 (No zero)
  (2,1) â†’ 10 (No zero)
  (2,2) â†’ 11 (No zero)
  (2,3) â†’ 0 (Zero found!) â†’ row[2] = 1, col[3] = 1
  ```
- **We marked:** `row[2] = 1`, `col[3] = 1` because `(2,3)` is a zero.

---
### **Iteration 4: i = 3 (Fourth Row)**
- The fourth row is `(3,0) â†’ (3,1) â†’ (3,2) â†’ (3,3)`
- The loop processes:
  ```
  (3,0) â†’ 13 (No zero)
  (3,1) â†’ 14 (No zero)
  (3,2) â†’ 15 (No zero)
  (3,3) â†’ 16 (No zero)
  ```
- **No zero found, so no changes in row or col arrays.**

---
## **Final Marking Result**
After **all iterations**, our row and col arrays look like this:

- `row = [0, 1, 1, 0]` (Row 1 and Row 2 should be zeroed)
- `col = [0, 1, 0, 1]` (Column 1 and Column 3 should be zeroed)

---
## **Final Observations**
1. **Row-wise Traversal:**
   - The outer loop (`i`) ensures we traverse each row **completely** before moving to the next.
   - The inner loop (`j`) ensures **each row is processed from left to right** before moving down.

2. **Marking Process:**
   - If a `0` is found in `matrix[i][j]`, we mark:
     - `row[i] = 1` (this row needs to be zeroed)
     - `col[j] = 1` (this column needs to be zeroed)
   - These marks are **saved for later use**, meaning no changes are made to the matrix yet.

---
## **Output of the Traversal**
If you were printing `(i, j)` step by step, you'd see:

```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)  // Found a zero at (1,1)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)  // Found a zero at (2,3)
(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
```
- **Traversal is row-wise (left to right, then down).**
- **Zeros are found and marked immediately in `row` and `col` arrays.**
- **No changes are made to the matrix yet**â€”only marking is done.
